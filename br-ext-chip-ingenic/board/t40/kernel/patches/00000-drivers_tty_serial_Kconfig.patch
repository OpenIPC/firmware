+	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to use a serial port as the
+	  system console (the system console is the device which receives all
+	  kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user
+	  mode). This could be useful if some terminal or printer is connected
+	  to that serial port.
+
+	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
+	  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
+	  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
+	  "console=ttyS1". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
+	  your boot loader (grub or lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options
+	  to the kernel at boot time.)
+
+	  If you don't have a VGA card installed and you say Y here, the
+	  kernel will automatically use the first serial line, /dev/ttyS0, as
+	  system console.

+	  If unsure, say N.
