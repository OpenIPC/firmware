+          The Direction Memory Access(EDMA) is a high-speed data transfer
+          operation. It supports data read/write between peripherals and
+          memories without using the CPU.
+          Goke EDMA Controller(EDMAC) directly transfers data between
+          a memory and a peripheral, between peripherals, or between memories.
+          This avoids the CPU intervention and reduces the interrupt handling
+          overhead of the CPU.
