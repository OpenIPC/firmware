+/**
+ * DOC:
+ * The "Always on" power management policy has the following
+ * characteristics:
+ *
+ * - When KBase indicates that the GPU will be powered up, but we don't yet
+ *   know which Job Chains are to be run:
+ *    All Shader Cores are powered up, regardless of whether or not they will
+ *    be needed later.
+ *
+ * - When KBase indicates that a set of Shader Cores are needed to submit the
+ *   currently queued Job Chains:
+ *    All Shader Cores are kept powered, regardless of whether or not they will
+ *    be needed
+ *
+ * - When KBase indicates that the GPU need not be powered:
+ *    The Shader Cores are kept powered, regardless of whether or not they will
+ *    be needed. The GPU itself is also kept powered, even though it is not
+ *    needed.
+ *
+ * This policy is automatically overridden during system suspend: the desired
+ * core state is ignored, and the cores are forced off regardless of what the
+ * policy requests. After resuming from suspend, new changes to the desired
+ * core state made by the policy are honored.
+ *
+ * Note:
+ *
+ * - KBase indicates the GPU will be powered up when it has a User Process that
+ *   has just started to submit Job Chains.
+ *
+ * - KBase indicates the GPU need not be powered when all the Job Chains from
+ *   User Processes have finished, and it is waiting for a User Process to
+ *   submit some more Job Chains.
