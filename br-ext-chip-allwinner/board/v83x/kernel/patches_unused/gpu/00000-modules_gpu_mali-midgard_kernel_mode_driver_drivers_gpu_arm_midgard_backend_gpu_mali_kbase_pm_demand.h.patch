+/**
+ * DOC: Demand power management policy
+ *
+ * The demand power management policy has the following characteristics:
+ * - When KBase indicates that the GPU will be powered up, but we don't yet
+ *   know which Job Chains are to be run:
+ *  - The Shader Cores are not powered up
+ *
+ * - When KBase indicates that a set of Shader Cores are needed to submit the
+ *   currently queued Job Chains:
+ *  - Only those Shader Cores are powered up
+ *
+ * - When KBase indicates that the GPU need not be powered:
+ *  - The Shader Cores are powered off, and the GPU itself is powered off too.
+ *
+ * Note:
+ * - KBase indicates the GPU will be powered up when it has a User Process that
+ *   has just started to submit Job Chains.
+ *
+ * - KBase indicates the GPU need not be powered when all the Job Chains from
+ *   User Processes have finished, and it is waiting for a User Process to
+ *   submit some more Job Chains.
