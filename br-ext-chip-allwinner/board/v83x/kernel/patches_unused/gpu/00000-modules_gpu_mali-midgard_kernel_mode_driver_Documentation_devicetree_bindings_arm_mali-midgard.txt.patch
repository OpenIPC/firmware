+* ARM Mali Midgard devices
+
+
+Required properties:
+
+- compatible : Should be mali<chip>, replacing digits with x from the back,
+until malit<Major>xx, ending with arm,mali-midgard, the latter not optional.
+- reg : Physical base address of the device and length of the register area.
+- interrupts : Contains the three IRQ lines required by T-6xx devices
+- interrupt-names : Contains the names of IRQ resources in the order they were
+provided in the interrupts property. Must contain: "JOB, "MMU", "GPU".
+
+Optional:
+
+- clocks : Phandle to clock for the Mali T-6xx device.
+- clock-names : Shall be "clk_mali".
+- mali-supply : Phandle to regulator for the Mali device. Refer to
+Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt for details.
+- operating-points : Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/opp.txt
+for details.
+- jm_config : For T860/T880. Sets job manager configuration. An array containing:
+	- 1 to override the TIMESTAMP value, 0 otherwise.
+	- 1 to override clock gate, forcing them to be always on, 0 otherwise.
+	- 1 to enable job throttle, limiting the number of cores that can be started
+	  simultaneously, 0 otherwise.
+	- Value between 0 and 63 (including). If job throttle is enabled, this is one
+	  less than the number of cores that can be started simultaneously.
+- power_model : Sets power model parameters. Note that this model was designed for the Juno
+	        platform, and may not be suitable for other platforms. A structure containing :
+	- compatible: Should be arm,mali-simple-power-model
+	- dynamic-coefficient: Coefficient, in pW/(Hz V^2), which is multiplied
+	  by v^2*f to calculate the dynamic power consumption.
+	- static-coefficient: Coefficient, in uW/V^3, which is multiplied by
+	  v^3 to calculate the static power consumption.
+	- ts: An array containing coefficients for the temperature scaling
+	  factor. This is used to scale the static power by a factor of
+	  tsf/1000000, where tsf = ts[3]*T^3 + ts[2]*T^2 + ts[1]*T + ts[0],
+	  and T = temperature in degrees.
+	- thermal-zone: A string identifying the thermal zone used for the GPU
+- system-coherency : Sets the coherency protocol to be used for coherent
+		     accesses made from the GPU.
+		     If not set then no coherency is used.
+	- 0  : ACE-Lite
+	- 1  : ACE
+	- 31 : No coherency
+- ipa-model : Sets the IPA model to be used for power management. GPU probe will fail if the
+	      model is not found in the registered models list. If no model is specified here,
+	      a gpu-id based model is picked if available, otherwise the default model is used.
+	- mali-simple-power-model: Default model used on mali
+- protected-mode-switcher : Phandle to device implemented protected mode switching functionality.
+Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/smc-protected-mode-switcher.txt for one implementation.
+
+Example for a Mali-T602:
+
+gpu@0xfc010000 {
+	compatible = "arm,malit602", "arm,malit60x", "arm,malit6xx", "arm,mali-midgard";
+	reg = <0xfc010000 0x4000>;
+	interrupts = <0 36 4>, <0 37 4>, <0 38 4>;
+	interrupt-names = "JOB", "MMU", "GPU";
+
+	clocks = <&pclk_mali>;
+	clock-names = "clk_mali";
+	mali-supply = <&vdd_mali>;
+	operating-points = <
+		/* KHz   uV */
+		533000 1250000,
+		450000 1150000,
+		400000 1125000,
+		350000 1075000,
+		266000 1025000,
+		160000  925000,
+		100000  912500,
+	>;
+	power_model {
+		compatible = "arm,mali-simple-power-model";
+		static-coefficient = <2427750>;
+		dynamic-coefficient = <4687>;
+		ts = <20000 2000 (-20) 2>;
+		thermal-zone = "gpu";
+	};
