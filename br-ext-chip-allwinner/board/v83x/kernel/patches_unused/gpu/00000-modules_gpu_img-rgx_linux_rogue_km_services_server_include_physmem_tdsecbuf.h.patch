+ * the SoC implementor if necessary.
+ *
+ * Calling this function will create a PMR for a memory allocation made
+ * in "secure buffer memory". It will only be writable by a trusted
+ * entity and when the feature is enabled on the SoC the GPU will only
+ * be able to perform operations permitted by security rules.
