+Building the UMP Device Driver for Linux
+----------------------------------------
+
+Build the UMP Device Driver for Linux by running the following make command:
+
+KDIR=<kdir_path> CONFIG=<your_config> BUILD=<build_option> make
+
+where
+    kdir_path: Path to your Linux Kernel directory
+    your_config: Name of the sub-folder to find the required config.h file
+                 ("arch-" will be prepended)
+    build_option: debug or release. Debug is default.
+
+The config.h contains following configuration parameters:
+
+ARCH_UMP_BACKEND_DEFAULT
+    0 specifies the dedicated memory allocator.
+    1 specifies the OS memory allocator.
+ARCH_UMP_MEMORY_ADDRESS_DEFAULT
+    This is only required for the dedicated memory allocator, and specifies
+    the physical start address of the memory block reserved for UMP.
+ARCH_UMP_MEMORY_SIZE_DEFAULT
+    This specified the size of the memory block reserved for UMP, or the
+    maximum limit for allocations from the OS.
+
+The result will be a ump.ko file, which can be loaded into the Linux kernel
+by using the insmod command. The driver can also be built as a part of the
+kernel itself.
