+@Title          Wrapper around drm_fourcc.h
+@Description    FourCCs and the DRM framebuffer modifiers should be added here
+                unless they are used by kernel code or a known user outside of
+				the DDK. If FourCCs or DRM framebuffer modifiers are required
+				outside of the DDK, they shall be moved to the corresponding
+				public header.
