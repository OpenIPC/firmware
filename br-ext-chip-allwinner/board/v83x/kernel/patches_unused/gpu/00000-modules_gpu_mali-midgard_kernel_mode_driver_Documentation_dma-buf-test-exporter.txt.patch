+dma-buf-test-exporter
+=====================
+
+Overview
+--------
+
+The dma-buf-test-exporter is a simple exporter of dma_buf objects.
+It has a private API to allocate and manipulate the buffers which are represented as dma_buf fds.
+The private API allows:
+* simple allocation of physically non-contiguous buffers
+* simple allocation of physically contiguous buffers
+* query kernel side API usage stats (number of attachments, number of mappings, mmaps)
+* failure mode configuration (fail attach, mapping, mmap)
+* kernel side memset of buffers
+
+The buffers support all of the dma_buf API, including mmap.
+
+It supports being compiled as a module both in-tree and out-of-tree.
+
+See include/linux/dma-buf-test-exporter.h for the ioctl interface.
+See Documentation/dma-buf-sharing.txt for details on dma_buf.
