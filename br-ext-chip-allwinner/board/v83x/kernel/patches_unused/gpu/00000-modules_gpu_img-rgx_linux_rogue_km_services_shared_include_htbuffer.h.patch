+@Title          Host Trace Buffer shared API.
+@Copyright      Copyright (c) Imagination Technologies Ltd. All Rights Reserved
+@Description    Host Trace Buffer provides a mechanism to log Host events to a
+                buffer in a similar way to the Firmware Trace mechanism.
+                Host Trace Buffer logs data using a Transport Layer buffer.
+                The Transport Layer and pvrtld tool provides the mechanism to
+                retrieve the trace data.
