+	default n
+	help
+	  Enable this option to build support for a ARM Mali Midgard GPU.
+
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
+	  this will generate a single module, called mali_kbase.
+
+config MALI_GATOR_SUPPORT
+	bool "Streamline support via Gator"
+	depends on MALI_MIDGARD
+	default n
+	help
+	  Adds diagnostic support for use with the ARM Streamline Performance Analyzer.
+	  You will need the Gator device driver already loaded before loading this driver when enabling
+	  Streamline debug support.
+	  This is a legacy interface required by older versions of Streamline.
+
+config MALI_MIDGARD_DVFS
+	bool "Enable legacy DVFS"
+	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && !MALI_DEVFREQ && !MALI_PLATFORM_DEVICETREE

+
+config MALI_MIDGARD_ENABLE_TRACE
+	bool "Enable kbase tracing"
+	depends on MALI_MIDGARD
+	default n
+	help
+	  Enables tracing in kbase.  Trace log available through
+	  the "mali_trace" debugfs file, when the CONFIG_DEBUG_FS is enabled
+
+config MALI_DEVFREQ
+	bool "devfreq support for Mali"
+	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && PM_DEVFREQ
+	help
+	  Support devfreq for Mali.
+
+	  Using the devfreq framework and, by default, the simpleondemand
+	  governor, the frequency of Mali will be dynamically selected from the
+	  available OPPs.
+
+config MALI_DMA_FENCE
+	bool "DMA_BUF fence support for Mali"
+	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && !KDS
+	default n
+	help
+	  Support DMA_BUF fences for Mali.
+
+	  This option should only be enabled if KDS is not present and
+	  the Linux Kernel has built in support for DMA_BUF fences.
+
+# MALI_EXPERT configuration options
+
+menuconfig MALI_EXPERT
+	depends on MALI_MIDGARD
+	bool "Enable Expert Settings"
+	default n
+	help
+	  Enabling this option and modifying the default settings may produce a driver with performance or
+	  other limitations.
+
+config MALI_CORESTACK
+	bool "Support controlling power to the GPU core stack"
+	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_EXPERT
+	default n
+	help
+	  Enabling this feature on supported GPUs will let the driver powering
+	  on/off the GPU core stack independently without involving the Power
+	  Domain Controller. This should only be enabled on platforms which
+	  integration of the PDC to the Mali GPU is known to be problematic.
+	  This feature is currently only supported on t-Six and t-HEx GPUs.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+
+config MALI_PRFCNT_SET_SECONDARY
+	bool "Use secondary set of performance counters"
+	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_EXPERT
+	default n
+	help
+	  Select this option to use secondary set of performance counters. Kernel
+	  features that depend on an access to the primary set of counters may
+	  become unavailable. Enabling this option will prevent power management
+	  from working optimally and may cause instrumentation tools to return
+	  bogus results.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+
+config MALI_PLATFORM_FAKE
+	bool "Enable fake platform device support"
+	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_EXPERT
+	default n
+	help
+	  When you start to work with the Mali Midgard series device driver the platform-specific code of
+	  the Linux kernel for your platform may not be complete. In this situation the kernel device driver
+	  supports creating the platform device outside of the Linux platform-specific code.
+	  Enable this option if would like to use a platform device configuration from within the device driver.

+
+config MALI_PLATFORM_DEVICETREE
+	bool "Device Tree platform"
+	depends on OF
+	help
+	  Select this option to use Device Tree with the Mali driver.
+
+	  When using this option the Mali driver will get the details of the
+	  GPU hardware from the Device Tree. This means that the same driver
+	  binary can run on multiple platforms as long as all the GPU hardware
+	  details are described in the device tree.
+
+	  Device Tree is the recommended method for the Mali driver platform
+	  integration.

+	default y if MALI_DEBUG
+	help
+	  Select this option to enable additional checking and reporting on the
+	  use of sync fences in the Mali driver.
+
+	  This will add a 3s timeout to all sync fence waits in the Mali
+	  driver, so that when work for Mali has been waiting on a sync fence
+	  for a long time a debug message will be printed, detailing what fence
+	  is causing the block, and which dependent Mali atoms are blocked as a
+	  result of this.
+
+	  The timeout can be changed at runtime through the js_soft_timeout
+	  device attribute, where the timeout is specified in milliseconds.
+
+config MALI_NO_MALI
+	bool "No Mali"
+	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_EXPERT
+	default n
+	help
+	  This can be used to test the driver in a simulated environment
+	  whereby the hardware is not physically present. If the hardware is physically
+	  present it will not be used. This can be used to test the majority of the
+	  driver without needing actual hardware or for software benchmarking.
+	  All calls to the simulated hardware will complete immediately as if the hardware
+	  completed the task.
+
+config MALI_ERROR_INJECT
+	bool "Error injection"
+	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_EXPERT && MALI_NO_MALI

+	help
+	  Choose this option to enable system trace events for each

+	  minimal overhead when not in use. Enable only if you know what
+	  you are doing.
+
+config MALI_GPU_MMU_AARCH64
+	bool "Use AArch64 page tables"
+	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_EXPERT
+	default n
+	help
+	  Use AArch64 format page tables for the GPU instead of LPAE-style.
+	  The two formats have the same functionality and performance but a
+	  future GPU may deprecate or remove the legacy LPAE-style format.
+
+	  The LPAE-style format is supported on all Midgard and current Bifrost
+	  GPUs. Enabling AArch64 format restricts the driver to only supporting
+	  Bifrost GPUs.
+
+	  If in doubt, say N.
+
+config MALI_PWRSOFT_765
+	bool "PWRSOFT-765 ticket"
+	default n
+	help
+	  PWRSOFT-765 fixes devfreq cooling devices issues. However, they are
+	  not merged in mainline kernel yet. So this define helps to guard those
+	  parts of the code.
