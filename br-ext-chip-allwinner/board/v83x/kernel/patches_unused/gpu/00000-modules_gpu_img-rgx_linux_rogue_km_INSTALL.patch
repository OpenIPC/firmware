+Rogue Embedded Systems DDK for the Linux kernel.
+Copyright (C) Imagination Technologies Ltd. All rights reserved.
+======================================================================
+
+This file covers how to build and install the Imagination Technologies
+Rogue DDK for the Linux kernel.  For full details, see the relevant platform
+guide.
+
+
+Build System Environment Variables
+-------------------------------------------
+
+The Rogue DDK Build scripts depend on a number of environment variables
+being setup before compilation or installation of DDK software can
+commence:
+
+$DISCIMAGE
+The DDK Build scripts install files to the location specified by the
+DISCIMAGE environment variable.  To do so, they need to know where the 
+target system image resides: 
+$ export DISCIMAGE=/path/to/filesystem
+If you are building on the target system, you can set this to '/'.
+
+$KERNELDIR
+When building the Rogue DDK kernel module, the build needs access
+to the headers of the Linux kernel.
+If you are building on the target machine, you can set this as follows:
+$ export KERNELDIR=/usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r`
+
+$CROSS_COMPILE
+If you intend on targeting a platform that is different from your build
+machine (e.g.,if you are compiling on an x86 but targeting ARM) you need
+to set the CROSS_COMPILE variable so that the build system uses the correct
+compiler. E.g., 
+$ export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
+
+
+Build and Install Instructions
+-------------------------------------------
+
+The Rogue DDK configures different target builds within directories under
+build/linux/.
+
+The most interesting build targets are:
+
+	build   Makes everything
+	clobber Removes all binaries for all builds as well.
+	install Runs the install script generated by the build.
+
+The following variables may be set on the command line to influence a build.
+
+	BUILD   The type of build being performed.
+                Alternatives are release, timing or debug.
+
+To build for, change to the appropriate target directory, e.g.:
+$ cd rogue_km/build/linux/<platform>
+$ make BUILD=debug
+$ sudo -E make install BUILD=debug
