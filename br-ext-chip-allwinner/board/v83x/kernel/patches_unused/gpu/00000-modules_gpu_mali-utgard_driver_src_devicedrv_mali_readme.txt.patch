+Building the Mali Device Driver for Linux
+-----------------------------------------
+
+Build the Mali Device Driver for Linux by running the following make command:
+
+KDIR=<kdir_path> USING_UMP=<ump_option> BUILD=<build_option> make
+
+where
+    kdir_path: Path to your Linux Kernel directory
+    ump_option: 1 = Enable UMP support(*)
+                0 = disable UMP support
+    build_option: debug = debug build of driver
+                  release = release build of driver
+
+(*)  For newer Linux Kernels, the Module.symvers file for the UMP device driver
+     must be available. The UMP_SYMVERS_FILE variable in the Makefile should
+     point to this file. This file is generated when the UMP driver is built.
+
+The result will be a mali.ko file, which can be loaded into the Linux kernel
+by using the insmod command.
+
+Use of UMP is not recommended. The dma-buf API in the Linux kernel has
+replaced UMP. The Mali Device Driver will be built with dma-buf support if the
+kernel config includes enabled dma-buf.
+
+The kernel needs to be provided with a platform_device struct for the Mali GPU
+device. See the mali_utgard.h header file for how to set up the Mali GPU
+resources.
