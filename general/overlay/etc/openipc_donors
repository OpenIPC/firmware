 Please help the OpenIPC Project to cover the cost of development and
 long-term maintenance of what we believe is going to become a stable,
 flexible Open IP Network Camera Framework for users worldwide.

 Your contributions could help us to advance the development and keep
 you updated on improvements and new features more regularly.
