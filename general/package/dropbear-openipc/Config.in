	  A small SSH 2 server designed for small memory environments.

	  Note that dropbear requires a per-device unique host key. The
	  key will be generated when dropbear starts, but it is not
	  persistent over reboot (if you have a read-only rootfs) or
	  upgrade (if you have a read-write rootfs). To make the key
	  persistent, replace /etc/dropbear with a symlink to a
	  directory on a persistent, writeable filesystem.
	  Alternatively, mount a persistent unionfs over your root
	  filesystem.

config BR2_PACKAGE_DROPBEAR_OPENIPC_CLIENT
	bool "client programs"
	default y
	help
	  Provides the programs: dbclient, ssh

	  Note that the following programs are also used server-side
	  and are therefore always build regardless this setting:
	  dropbear, dropbearkey, dropbearconvert, scp

config BR2_PACKAGE_DROPBEAR_OPENIPC_DISABLE_REVERSEDNS
	bool "disable reverse DNS lookups"
	help
	  Disable reverse DNS lookups on connection. This can be handy
	  on systems without working DNS, as connections otherwise
	  stall until DNS times out.

config BR2_PACKAGE_DROPBEAR_OPENIPC_SMALL
	bool "optimize for size"
	default y
	help
	  Compile dropbear for the smallest possible binary size.

	  Tradeoffs are slower hashes and ciphers, and disabling of the
	  blowfish cipher and zlib.

config BR2_PACKAGE_DROPBEAR_OPENIPC_WTMP
	bool "log dropbear access to wtmp"
	help
	  Enable logging of dropbear access to wtmp. Notice that
	  Buildroot does not generate wtmp by default.

config BR2_PACKAGE_DROPBEAR_OPENIPC_LASTLOG
	bool "log dropbear access to lastlog"
	help
	  Enable logging of dropbear access to lastlog. Notice that
	  Buildroot does not generate lastlog by default.

config BR2_PACKAGE_DROPBEAR_OPENIPC_LEGACY_CRYPTO
	bool "enable legacy crypto"
	help
	  Enable legacy and possibly insecure algorithms:
	    3DES encryption
	    SHA1-96 message integrity
	    CBC encryption mode
	    DSA public keys
	    Diffie-Hellman Group1 key exchange

config BR2_PACKAGE_DROPBEAR_OPENIPC_LOCALOPTIONS_FILE
	string "path to custom localoptions.h definitions file"
	help
	  Path to a file whose contents will be appended to Dropbear
	  localoptions.h. It can be used to tweak the Dropbear
