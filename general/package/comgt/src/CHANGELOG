    - Scripts distributed with package are now located in scripts sub-directory

   - changed option handler to avoid reporting a NULL option when no
     arguments were supplied or when an invalid option was given.
   - changed the help display to fit neatly on a 25 x 80 telnet or
     ssh screen.
   - created the man page from dcon and previous gcom documentation.
   - created the COMPILING, CHANGELOG, MANIFEST and TODO files from
     pre-existing documentation.

October 2003 Paul Hardwick
   0 Minor changes to make dcon compile with current gcc without 
     errors or warnings.
   1 Added gcom.h which provides "built-in" scripts and a support 
     routine of specific use to (Option) gsm type modems.
   2 Modified script loading so that by default every script is 
     pre-pended with an internal "default" script that opens the 
     serial port correctly, checks if a PIN is required (prompting 
     the user if needed) then checks registration status and signal 
     strength. If you call the other built-in scripts then this 
     default is not executed.
   3 Added "-s" option to skip the internal default script. If this 
     option is used then the user must manually open the serial port 
     with the right baud rate.

   - Made it case independent.
   - Happy new year!
   - Indexed labels, major speed improvement.

Mon Dec 30 21:10:46 EST 1996 not distributed
   - Fixed select() on comfd so that `pppd connect 'dcon script'` works again.


Mon Dec 23 16:10:24 EST 1996 not distributed
 22 hour session!
   - Added $right(), $left(), $dirname(), $basename(), $hex(), $hexu(), $oct(),
     $script(), $tolower(), $toupper(), and verbose() functions.
   - Added abort, flash, and dump commands.
   - Fixed #!/usr/local/bin/dcon support.
   - Fixed re-entrant getstring() bug.
   - Normalized gettoken() and getstring()
   - Used getopt() instead of if...else if...else if...
   - Added 0xffff (hex), 07777 (octal), 0%1111 (binary) notations.
   - Added [$]a0-z9 variable ranges and managed (Woohee!) to keep it
     compatible with old syntax.
   - Only allocate strings as needed.
   - Much better error reporting and exit code handling.
   - Pulled a groin muscle while sitting crooked.  Go figure.
   - Created makescript.

Wed Dec 11 18:30:42 EST 1996
   - Changed my E-mail address in doc.
   - Added a fix to dogoto() so that the label gets printed in log
     (less confusing to see if a goto or gosub in test executed or not.)
   - Had lasagna for supper.

Sometime a while ago before I moved (August 1996, I think)
   - Ansified code and Makefile, contributed by John Gotts.
     (You guys out there are such purists!  :)

   - Better error reporting.

Fri Jul 19 22:29:37 EDT 1996
   - Got a bug report from Glen Thigpen that dcon-0.91 reports "Token too long"
     errors.  Found that dcon didn't deal with non-terminated last lines
     properly.  Fixed.

Mon Apr 29 21:38:04 EDT 1996  V: 0.95
   - Got a bug report from J. Van Koll reporting that the included
     ppp-ex.scr had two lines that were truncated.  Modified ppp-ex.scr
