_(based on Buildroot)_

OpenIPC is a rapidly developing open source alternative [firmware][firmware] for 
popular IP cameras from an [open community](https://opencollective.com/openipc).

Historically, OpenIPC [firmware][firmware] only supported SoC manufactured by 
HiSilicon, but as the development continues, the list of supported processors
expands. Today, it also includes chips from _Ambarella_, _Anyka_, _Fullhan_, _Goke_,
_GrainMedia_, _Ingenic_, _MStar_, _Novatek_, _SigmaStar_, _XiongMai_, and is 
expected to grow further.
